## Purpose

I am working with some new and interesting distros ( ex. Nitrux, Guix and Nitrix ), but want to work on other projects at the same.  I have 
decided to use an OS that is closer to my comfort level so I can learn the other OSs while making progress on the other projects

## Installation

<li>My disk format contains 3 partions : An UEFI, A Linux Partition and Swap</li>
