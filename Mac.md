# Macintosh Configuration

## Settings

* If the setting is not mentioned then it should not be configured.

| Setting | Configuration | 
| ------- | ------------- | 
| Network | Firewall should be inactive |
| Network | Thunderbolt should be inactive |
| General | Local hostname should be change to Thor.local to make it unique |
| Control Center | Control Center Modules -- Sound should be set to always in menubar |
| Desktop & Dock | Minimize when using -- Select "Genie Effect" |
| Desktop & Dock | Show suggested and recent apps in Docks | 




## TODO

### Network -- Enable firewall and configure
The firewall should be enabled and confgirued for the following reasons
* When working with localhost, creating vulnerable channels can allow outsiders to connect to your mac.
* Downloading software from the internet can contain malware.

### Netowrk -- Should Thunderbolt Bridge be enabled ?
Thunderbolt Bridge is a high speed connection between two computer both have a thunderbolt port.  Is there any benefit to me ?

### General -- Conetent & Media, Accessories and Internet, Advanced
All these items seem to talk about shareing.  How can these be used to create a cohesive environment.  Since there are many different parts we could create an epic for this item if Github will permit.

### Understand Stage Manager
I have no clue what Stage Manager is and then return to Desktop & Dock and look and decide on the changes ot settings
