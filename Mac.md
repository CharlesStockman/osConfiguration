# Macintosh Configuration

## Settings

* If the setting is not mentioned then it should not be configured.

| Setting | Configuration | 
| ------- | ------------- | 
| Network | Firewall should be inactive |
| Network | Thunderbolt should be inactive |

## TODO

### Network -- Enable firewall and configure
The firewall should be enabled and confgirued for the following reasons
* When working with localhost, creating vulnerable channels can allow outsiders to connect to your mac.
* Downloading software from the internet can contain malware.

### Netowrk -- Should Thunderbolt Bridge be enabled ?
Thunderbolt Bridge is a high speed connection between two computer both have a thunderbolt port.  Is there any benefit to me ?
